To use mit-tab with Apache, do the following:
1) Copy the mit-tab directory into /var/www/tab/. Make sure that
the http user (depends on your apache deployment) has read and write
permissions to this directory.
    # All as root
    cd /var/www
    git clone https://github.com/jolynch/mit-tab.git tab
    chown -R root:www-data tab
    cd tab
    chmod 770 mittab
2) Copy the provided "tab" configuration to the sites-available directory
in your apache configuration directory. E.G. /etc/apache2
3) Modify the tab configuration to suit your system.  In general this
consists of changing the django paths to point to the right place.

Occasionally you have to:
    cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/static
    ln -s admin/* .
